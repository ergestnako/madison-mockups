    <p>{{ "I'm Congressman Seth Moulton, and I want to hear your thoughts on President Trump's budget blueprint here in Madison. I want to hear directly from you about how the President's budget impacts you, your family, your business, and your ability to achieve the American dream.

A budget shows what we care about. It shows our values. As Americans, we care about creating good paying jobs so that everyone who works hard gets a shot at the American Dream. And we care about national security: our most solemn obligation is to keep Americans safe at home and abroad." | truncatewords: 20  }}</p>
