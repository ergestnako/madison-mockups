        <p>I'm Congressman Seth Moulton, and I want to hear your thoughts on President Trump's budget blueprint here in Madison. I want to hear directly from you about how the President's budget impacts you, your family, your business, and your ability to achieve the American dream. </p>
        <p>A budget shows what we care about. It shows our values. As Americans, we care about creating good paying jobs so that everyone who works hard gets a shot at the American Dream. And we care about national security: our most solemn obligation is to keep Americans safe at home and abroad.</p>
        <p>I believe that President Trump's budget isn’t serious about moving our economy forward or keeping Americans safe. How do I know? Guess what word he never once mentions in his introduction: <strong>Jobs.</strong> Think that’s a fluke? Here are some other things he never mentions: <strong>The Economy. Opportunity. Innovation. Entrepreneurship. Infrastructure Investment. Research and Development.</strong> These are all critical components to reigniting the American Dream.</p>
