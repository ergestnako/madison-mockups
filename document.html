          <p>I'm Congressman Seth Moulton, and I want to hear your thoughts on President Trump's budget blueprint here in Madison. I want to hear directly from you about how the President's budget impacts you, your family, your business, and your ability to achieve the American dream. </p>
          <p>A budget shows what we care about. It shows our values. As Americans, we care about creating good paying jobs so that everyone who works hard gets a shot at the American Dream. And we care about national security: our most solemn obligation is to keep Americans safe at home and abroad.</p>
          <p>I believe that President Trump's budget isn’t serious about moving our economy forward or keeping Americans safe. How do I know? Guess what word he never once mentions in his introduction: <strong>Jobs.</strong> Think that’s a fluke? Here are some other things he never mentions: <strong>The Economy. Opportunity. Innovation. Entrepreneurship. Infrastructure Investment. Research and Development.</strong> These are all critical components to reigniting the American Dream.</p>

        <p id="annotationGroup-46"><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2356" name="annotation_2356">Beginning a New Chapter of American Greatness</span></p>
        <p>A MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-47">The American people elected me to fight for their priorities in Washington, D.C. and deliver on my promise to protect our Nation.<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2371" name="annotation_2371">  I fully intend to keep that promise.</span></p>
        <p>One of the most important ways the Federal Government sets priorities is through the Budget of the United States.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-41">Accordingly, I submit to the Congress this Budget Blueprint to reprioritize Federal spending so that it <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2303" name="annotation_2303"><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2677" name="annotation_2677">advances the safety and security of the American people</span>.</span>
        </p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-48">Our aim is to meet the simple, but crucial demand of our citizens—a <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2646" name="annotation_2646">Government that puts the needs of its own people first.</span> <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2374" name="annotation_2374">When we do that, we will set free the dreams of every American, and we will begin a new chapter of American greatness.</span></p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-33">A budget that puts America first <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2254" name="annotation_2254">must make the safety of our people its number one priority</span>— <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2259" name="annotation_2259">because without safety, there can be no prosperity</span>.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-93">That is why I have instructed my Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, to craft a budget that emphasizes <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2940" name="annotation_2940">national security and public safety</span>. That work is reflected in this Budget Blueprint. <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2699" name="annotation_2699">To keep Americans safe, we have made tough choices that have been put off for too long.  But we have also made necessary investments that are long overdue.</span></p>

        <p id="annotationGroup-2">The core of my first Budget Blueprint is the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2152" name="annotation_2152">rebuilding of our Nation’s military</span> without adding to our Federal deficit. <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2394" name="annotation_2394">There is a $54 billion increase in defense spending in 2018 that is offset by targeted reductions elsewhere.</span> <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2967" name="annotation_2967">This defense funding is vital to rebuilding and preparing our Armed Forces for the future.</span>We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight, do only one thing: Win.

        <p id="annotationGroup-25">The defense and public safety spending increases in this Budget Blueprint are offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the Federal Government.

We are going to do <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2278" name="annotation_2278">more with less</span>, and make the Government lean and <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3034" name="annotation_3034">accountable to the people</span>. <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3142" name="annotation_3142">This includes </span><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2233" name="annotation_2233"><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3142" name="annotation_3142">deep cuts to foreign aid</span></span><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3142" name="annotation_3142">.</span> It is time to prioritize the security and well-being of Americans, and to ask the rest of the world to step up and pay its fair share.</p>

        <p>— Donald J. Trump</p>
        <h1 id="heading-2" class="anchor">A Message from the Director, Office of Management and Budget</h1>
        <p>I am proud to introduce the “America First” Budget.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-115">While recognizing this Blueprint is not the full Federal budget, it does provide lawmakers and the public with <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3040" name="annotation_3040">a view of the priorities of the President and his  Administration</span>. The Federal budget is a complex document. However, working for a President committed to keeping his promises means my job is as simple as translating his words into numbers.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-26">That is why you will find here a familiar focus on rebuilding and restoring our Nation’s security. Under the Obama Administration, <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2236" name="annotation_2236">our shrinking military has been stretched far  too thin</span>. The military has been forced to make <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2379" name="annotation_2379">aging ships, planes, and other vehicles last well beyond their intended life spans.</span> The President will reverse this dangerous trend. From rebuilding our Armed Forces to beefing up our border security and safeguarding our Nation’s sovereignty, this Budget <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3043" name="annotation_3043">makes security priority one</span>.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-52">It does so while meeting another of the President’s core commitments: addressing our Nation’s priorities <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2407" name="annotation_2407">without sending future generations an even bigger credit card  bill.</span> This 2018 Budget Blueprint will not add to the deficit. <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2409" name="annotation_2409">It has been crafted much the same way any American family creates its own budget while paying bills around their kitchen table;</span> it makes hard choices.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-99"><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2794" name="annotation_2794">The President’s commitment to fiscal responsibility is historic</span>. Not since early in President Reagan’s first term have more tax dollars been saved and more Government inefficiency and waste been targeted. Every corner of the Federal budget is scrutinized, every program tested, every penny of taxpayer money watched over.
          <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2970" name="annotation_2970">Our $20 trillion national debt is a crisis, not just for the Nation, but for every citizen.</span> Each American’s share of this debt is more than $60,000 and growing. It is a challenge of great stakes, but one the American people can solve. A<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2979" name="annotation_2979">merican families make tough decisions ever</span>y day about their own budgets; it is time Washington does the same.</p>
        <p>— Mick Mulvaney</p>
        <h1 id="heading-3" class="anchor">MAJOR AGENCY BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS</h1>
        <p>The 2018 Budget is being unveiled sequentially in that this Blueprint provides details only on our discretionary funding proposals. The full Budget that will be released later this spring will include our specific mandatory and tax proposals, as well as a full fiscal path.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-3">For instance, the President has emphasized that one of his top priorities is <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2154" name="annotation_2154">modernizing the outdated infrastructure</span> that the American public depends upon. To spearhead his infrastructure initiative, the President has tapped a group of infrastructure experts to evaluate investment options along with commonsense regulatory, administrative, organizational, and policy changes to encourage investment and speed project delivery. Through his initiative, the President is committed to making sure that taxpayer dollars are expended for the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3048" name="annotation_3048">highest return projects</span> and that all levels of government maximize leverage to get the best deals and<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2398" name="annotation_2398"> exercise vigorous oversigh</span>t. The Administration will provide more budgetary, tax, and legislative details in the coming months.</p>
        <p>In the chapters that follow, Budget highlights are presented for major agencies. Consistent with the President’s approach to move the Nation toward fiscal responsibility, the Budget eliminates and reduces hundreds of programs and focuses funding to redefine the proper role of the Federal Government.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-4">The Budget also proposes to eliminate funding for other independent agencies, including: the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2558" name="annotation_2558">African Development Foundation</span>; the<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2565" name="annotation_2565"> Appalachian Regional Commission</span>; the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2157" name="annotation_2157">Chemical  Safety  Board</span>; the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2663" name="annotation_2663">Corporation for National and Community Service</span>; the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2159" name="annotation_2159">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</span>; the Delta Regional Authority; the Denali Commission;<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3146" name="annotation_3146">  the Institute of Museum and Library Services</span>; the Inter-American Foundation; the U.S. Trade and Development Agency; the<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2465" name="annotation_2465"> Legal Services Corporation</span>; the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2162" name="annotation_2162">National Endowment  for the Arts</span>; the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3148" name="annotation_3148">National Endowment for the Humanities</span>; the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation; the Northern Border Regional Commission; the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; the <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2985" name="annotation_2985">United States Institute of Peace</span>; the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness; and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2418" name="annotation_2418">Scholars</span>.</p>
        <h1 id="heading-4" class="anchor">MANAGEMENT</h1>
        <p>Making Government Work Again</p>
        <p>The Federal Government can—and should— operate more effectively, efficiently, and securely. For decades, leaders on both sides of the aisle have talked about the need to make Government work better. The President is taking bold action now to make Government work again for the American people.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-5">As one of his first acts as President, on January 23, 2017, the President issued a memorandum imposing a Federal <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3060" name="annotation_3060">“Hiring Freeze”</span> and requiring a <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2165" name="annotation_2165">long-term plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government’s workforce</span>. In addition, on March 13, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13781 establishing a “<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2424" name="annotation_2424">Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch</span>,” which set in motion the important work of reorganizing executive departments and agencies. These two actions are complementary and plans should reflect both Presidential actions. Legislation will be required before major reorganization of the Executive Branch can take place, but the White House is best situated to review and recommend changes to the Congress. In roughly a year, the Congress will receive from the President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a comprehensive plan for <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2987" name="annotation_2987">reorganization proposals</span>. The White House will work closely with congressional committees with jurisdiction over Government organization to ensure the needed reforms actually happen.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, the Administration will develop the President’s Management Agenda focused on achieving significant improvements in the effectiveness of its core management functions. The President’s Management Agenda will set goals in areas that are critical to improving the Federal Government’s effectiveness, efficiency, cybersecurity, and accountability. The Administration will take action to ensure that by 2020 we will be able to say the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>

Furthermore, these Government-wide policies often tie agencies’ hands and keep managers from making commonsense decisions. As a result, costs often increase without corresponding benefits. The Administration will roll back low-value activities and let managers manage, while holding them accountable for finding ways to reduce the cost of agency operations. As part of this effort, <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3069" name="annotation_3069">OMB will review requirements placed on agencies and identify areas to reduce obsolete, low-value requirements</span>.</p>

        <h1 id="heading-5" class="anchor">REGULATION</h1>
        <p>Cutting Burdensome Regulations</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-111">The American people deserve a regulatory system that works for them, <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2993" name="annotation_2993">not against them</span>—a system that is both effective and efficient.</p>
        <p>Each year, however, Federal agencies issue thousands of new regulations that, taken together, impose substantial burdens on American consumers and businesses big and small. These burdens function much like taxes that unnecessarily inhibit growth and employment. Many regulations, though well intentioned, do not achieve their intended outcomes, are not structured in the most cost-effective manner, and often have adverse, unanticipated consequences. Many more regulations that have been on the books for years—even if they made sense at the time—have gone unexamined and may no longer be effective or necessary.</p>
        <p>The President is committed to fixing these problems by eliminating unnecessary and wasteful regulations. To that end, the President has already taken three significant steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p id="annotationGroup-61">Regulatory freeze— On January 20, 2017, the President’s Chief of Staff issued a memorandum to all agencies, directing them to <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2446" name="annotation_2446">pull back any regulations that had been sent to, but not yet published by, the Office of the Federal Register; to not publish any new regulations unless approved by an Administration political appointee; and to delay the effective date of any pending regulations for 60 days  to provide the Administration time to review and reconsider those regulations. Federal agencies responded by pulling back, delaying, and not publishing all possible regulations.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p id="annotationGroup-7">Controlling costs and eliminating <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2173" name="annotation_2173">unnecessary</span> regulations— On January 30, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13771, “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.” This Executive Order represents a fundamental change in the regulatory state. It requires Federal agencies to <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2720" name="annotation_2720">eliminate at least two existing regulations for each new regulation they issue.</span> It also requires agencies to ensure that for 2017, the<span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2755" name="annotation_2755"> total incremental cost of all new regulations be no greater than $0</span>. For 2018 and beyond, the Order establishes and institutionalizes a disciplined process for imposing regulatory <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2996" name="annotation_2996">cost caps</span> for each Federal agency. The significant structural reforms instituted by this Executive Order provide the necessary framework for Federal agencies to carry out the President’s bold regulatory reform agenda.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p id="annotationGroup-49">Enforcing the regulatory reform agenda— As <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2381" name="annotation_2381">a  successful businessman</span>, the President knows that achievement requires <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2998" name="annotation_2998">accountability</span>. That basic principle is the reason the President signed Executive Order 13777, “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,” on February 24, 2017. <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2457" name="annotation_2457">This Order establishes within each agency a Regulatory Reform Officer and a Regulatory  Reform Task  Force to carry out the President’s regulatory reform priorities.</span> These new teams will work hard to identify regulations that eliminate jobs or <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_3005" name="annotation_3005">inhibit job creation</span>; are outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective; or impose costs that exceed benefits.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p id="annotationGroup-8">They will also be responsible for ensuring that agencies comply with the President’s <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2686" name="annotation_2686">instruction to </span><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2176" name="annotation_2176"><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2429" name="annotation_2429"><span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2686" name="annotation_2686">eliminate two regulations for each new regulation</span></span>
          </span>; impose no new incremental costs through regulation; and undertake efforts to repeal, replace, or modify existing regulations.</p>
        <p>This Order builds upon a widely recognized and bi-partisan consensus that many existing regulations are likely to be ineffective and no longer necessary, and explicitly builds upon the retrospective review efforts initiated through Executive Order 13563. The difference, however, is accountability, and these teams will be a critical means by which Federal agencies will identify and cut regulations in a smart and efficient manner.</p>
        <p id="annotationGroup-50">The President recently told Americans, <span class="annotator-hl" id="annotation_2384" name="annotation_2384">“The era of empty talk is over.</span>” When it comes to regulatory reform, it is abundantly clear that the President means business. The President has put into place truly significant new structural mechanisms that will help to ensure that major regulatory reforms are finally achieved on behalf of the hardworking and forgotten men and women of America.</p>
        <p>The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB is already working hard to support the implementation of these critical new reforms, and it looks forward to making sure that they are fully and successfully implemented over the coming months and years.</p>

        <p>The President’s 2018 Budget:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Supports and expands public-private partnerships as the foundation of future U.S. civilian space efforts. The Budget creates new opportunities for collaboration with industry on space station operations, supports public-private partnerships for deep-space habitation and exploration systems, funds data buys from companies operating small satellite constellations, and supports work with industry to develop and commercialize new space technologies.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Paves the way for eventual over-land commercial supersonic flights and safer, more efficient air travel with a strong program of aeronautics research. The Budget provides $624 million for aeronautics research and development.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Reinvigorates robotic exploration of the Solar System by providing $1.9 billion for the Planetary Science program, including funding for a mission to repeatedly fly by Jupiter’s icy ocean moon Europa and a Mars rover that would launch in 2020. To preserve the balance of NASA’s science portfolio and maintain flexibility to conduct missions that were determined to be more important by the science community, the Budget provides no funding for a multi-billion-dollar mission to land on Europa. The Budget also supports initiatives that use smaller, less expensive satellites to advance science in a cost-effective manner.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Provides $3.7 billion for continued development of the Orion crew vehicle, Space Launch System, and associated ground system, to send American astronauts on deep-space missions. To accommodate increasing development costs, the Budget cancels the multi-billion-dollar Asteroid Redirect Mission. NASA will investigate approaches for reducing the costs of exploration missions to enable a more expansive exploration program.</p>
